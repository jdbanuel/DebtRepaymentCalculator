# DebtRepaymentCalculator

User inputs current debt

User will then enter in their APR e.g. 18% APR would be entered in as 18 and not 0.18

Then the user has two options to determine how to go about repaying their debt.

They can enter in their ideal monthly payment.
    - The application will then show the user how long (in months) it will take to payoff their debt.
    - It will also show the user how much interest they will have paid while paying off their debt.

-OR-

They can enter in the amount of time (in months) to payoff their debt.
    - The app will return the Avg Monthly Payment to payoff debt in the given timeframe.
    - It will also display the amount of interest the user will accrue/pay in the given timeframe.
